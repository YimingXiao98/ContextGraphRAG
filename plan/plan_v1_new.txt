Objective for 01/26 - 02/08:

We will focus on the Text-to-SQL agent in the first phase and PDF knowledge graph in the next phase. The primary target is to integrate the metadata as a knowledge graph to the Text-to-SQL agent to improve the quality of generated queries. 

For this phase we will work on two major components.

Schema Graph: 
Implementation of the knowledge graph using Neo4j
Holds information about the database metadata, primary key and foreign key relations, data definition library, definitions of different keywords 
Retriever logic to extract important information like table details, data threshold etc on the fly (e.g. when the user is asking about flood risk -> filter the tables that contain flood risk data -> determine the useful columns -> determine other useful parameters -> send to the agent)
Text-to-SQL Agent:
We can use LangGraph or similar packages
This is the main agent responsible for translating natural language to SQL query, execute the SQL query using a ODBC connection (we will create the DB using duckdb or similar to replicate a database environment for the agent)
Uses the schema graph to retrieve db related metadata (table names, column names, rules etc) and uses the additional context to generate the sql query
Executes the SQL query using SQLAlchemy or any similar SQL connection to extract required information from the database and provide as a JSON/CSV format.
Once steps a, b, c are completed (next phase), we may add a reflection mechanism to evaluate the model performance for a particular user query, store the metadata in a separate table and add as context to the schema graph (to convert knowledge graph to a context graph)
Evaluate performance (next phase):
Without using few-shot sample queries
With few-shot sample queries
With Chain-Of–Thought
With metadata as RAG
With Schema Graph

Plans for next two weeks:
Familiarizing ourselves with the packages, exploring more on the requirement and discuss the findings in the next call
Study regarding GraphRAG and context graphs, their implementation and retrieval logic
Familiarizing with the database (we can use the parquet files to explore the data until the database engine is set, we are working on it)
Sahil: Schema Graph + Retrieval, Christian: Text-to-SQL + Schema Graph Integration
